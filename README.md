# Bactocarb_Metanomics R Code #
Code Accompanying paper **"Metabolic plasticity of the gut microbiome in response to diets differing in glycemic load"**.

**Contents:** At current the repository contains the following modules.
   
**Code:**
Code was written in R version 4.3.1. 
1. "Cazyme_MixedEffectModel_testing.R" conducts Mixed Effect Model for the assocaition of CAZymes RNA/DNA ratio in high or low glycemic dietary load (corresponding to Table3 and Figure3B).
2. "MetaPhlanDNA_MixedEffectModel_testing.R" performs Mixed Effect Model for the association of Meta-Phlan DNA data in high or low glycemic dietary load (related to Figure1C). 
3. "Microbiome_Pathway_MixedEffectModel_testing.R" performs Mixed Effect Model for the association of the microbial pathway in either high or low glycemic dietary load (for Table2 and Figure2A), as well as the association with HOMA IR (related to Table4).
